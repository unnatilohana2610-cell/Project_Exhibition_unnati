Nervous Detection System

A real-time emotion and nervousness detection system using Streamlit, OpenCV, and deep learning. The app captures video and audio from the user, processes it with machine learning models, and analyzes facial expressions, body cues, and voice stress patterns to detect signs of nervousness.

Features

Live video stream analysis (facial expressions & micro-movements).

Audio stress detection from microphone input.

ML/AI-based prediction for nervousness levels.

Real-time visualization of detection results in the Streamlit UI.

☁️ Easy deployment using Streamlit Cloud.
